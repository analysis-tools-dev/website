            This project attracts a lot of engineers that care about
            code-quality and high engineering standards. We think this is an
            excellent opportunity to highlight solid analysis tools and
            workshops to a professional target audience.
          </p>
          <p tw="mb-3">
            <b>
              That's why we are currently looking for partners who want to
              sponsor hosting and development of the project.

          <p tw="mb-3">
            We believe that this project should be entirely open to avoid bias
            and gatekeepers, which promote tools purely based on monetary
            interest and not on quality. Since we want this to be a community
            project and the code/assets to be freely available to everyone,
            we’ll use Github Sponsors + Open Collective for funding.
          </p>
